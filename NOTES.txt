Hey, guys. Next time you open the project, you should use the virtual environment installed to it.

Each time you open the terminal, run the following command
The following command:        source venv/bin/activate

It will activate the virtual environment.
This is with also using the virtual environment as the interpreter.

I did this so I could use Django fully as the backend and frontend for the website that will run the database.
